# Kacy's Unix Journey

## Had to learn it for work so I am 

Why I wanted to learn Unix

- I support Mac now
- Coding is interesting
- I want to be more marketable 

Reasons I like this course

1) Not just someone talking on a video
2) Reading allows you to pace yourself
3) The exercises help burn in the content you just went over 

Macs will never be the standard for business but people feel better when they pay alot of money for shiny things.
